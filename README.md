# Dissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia Clients & Gateway + iOS Signer

## Android

Simple, just download the verison you want from the ``/Android`` folder along with the Gateway app. Install both on the device you want (you may have to make sure the device allows apps to be installed from unoffical sources). Run the Gateway app and enter the IP address and port of the device on the same network running the offline server. After entering the IP address and port number, flick the switch on the right and you should get a message saying your gateway is running (Note: While you can enter more than one IP address, changing it after you have activated one requires you to restart the app). Minimize the Gateway app (don't close it) and start the DFFOO client. After the game connects to the server, it won't matter if the Gateway app is still running.

## iOS

DFFOO for iOS is a little a different method. The client app has to have to server's IP address hardcoded to it. The Gateway app here is an ipa file signer that runs on your desktop first. It will create the desired verison ipa file to acceess the offline server on an iOS device.

Check the release for builds. Simply run the app and follow the prompts. Enter the version of the game you want and the IP address and port for the server you're connecting to.

It will generate a OperaOmnia_GL.ipa or OperaOmnia_JP.ipa file for sideloading. Check out [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/) or [Altstore](https://altstore.io/) for non-jailbroken methods of installing.
